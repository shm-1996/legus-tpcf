The info files contain the relavant information required for computing the TPCF for a galaxy. 
The info files for the galaxies in Menon et al 2021b would be created automatically when you initialise
an instance of the galaxy. If, however, you would like to perform TPCF analysis for a new galaxy outside
the sample, you would need to -- in addition to saving a catalog file and a region file/fits file of the galaxy 
in data/ -- create an info file here. Go through the formats of the other galaxies to see what you would need. 
Let me know if you have any questions: shyam.menon@anu.edu.au
